    "Below you can find a representation of the graph of the network of thrones and you can see it is a very complex network. Unfortunately it is very difficult to create such a graph with `networkx`, as a matter of fact `networkx` documentation says that it is better to use dedicated software for this. [Ref](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/drawing.html#:~:text=Proper%20graph%20visualization%20is%20hard%2C%20and%20we%20highly%20recommend%20that%20people%20visualize%20their%20graphs%20with%20tools%20dedicated%20to%20that%20task.%20Notable%20examples%20of%20dedicated%20and%20fully%2Dfeatured%20graph%20visualization%20tools%20are%20Cytoscape%2C%20Gephi%2C%20Graphviz%20and%2C%20for%20LaTeX%20typesetting%2C%20PGF/TikZ.) \n",

    "The goal of all data science projects is to answer a **specific** question. The network of thrones is a very complex network where no single character stands out as protagonist. As a matter of fact there is no protagonist in Game of Thrones, especially because you don't know if that character will survive till the end of the chapter. So let's try and find the answer to the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Who is the most important character in book 1 ?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Centrality\n",
    "But what does it mean to be _the most important character_ ? How do we define _important_ ? Well, in the world of TV critics everybody will have their opinion so let's create our own based on science. Luckily in network science we can measure the importance (or centrality) of each node. However, even in math there are multiple definitions of centrality. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality) is a list of possible network centrality measures. Obviously there are too many of them, so we will select only a few\n",
    "\n",
    "### Degree\n",
    "The simplest centrality measure is to count the number of edges connected to each node. This number is called the `degree` of each node and you can use the **method** [`degree`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.classes.function.degree.html#degree) to calculate it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighted Degree Centrality\n",
    "The second simplest centrality measure is to weight the degree of each node based on the weight of its edges. In other words calculated the degree of each node by summing the weight of each of its edges. `networkx` does not have a function to calculate this, however, the **method** [`degree`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.classes.function.degree.html#degree) does have an option `weight` in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### [Eigenvector Centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvector_centrality)\n",
    "Let's get a little more complex now. Graphs can be represented as square matrices as such we can do some linear algebra on them. Specifically, we can find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix. Mathematically, each node is given a score based on this equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n_i = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\sum_{j} a_{i,j} n_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_i$ is the $i$th node, $a_{i,j}$ is equal to 1 if the $n_i$ and $n_j$ are connected and 0 otherwise, and $\\lambda$ is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. In other words a high eigenvector centrality score for node $n_i$ indicates that it is connected to many other nodes who themselves have high eigenvector centrality scores. In terms of our network of thrones, it means that a character with a high eigenvector scores is connected to many other characters who themselves are well connected, _i.e._ how powerful are your connections? \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry I won't ask you to write a code to do the above math, `networkx` has a function for it. It is called, [`eigenvector_centrality`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.eigenvector_centrality.html). \n",

    "Notice that the matrix elements $a_{ij}$ above are either 1 or 0. What if we use the weights of the edges as the matrix elements? This can be easily done by adding the option `weight = \"weight\"` into the function [`eigenvector_centrality`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.eigenvector_centrality.html). \n",
